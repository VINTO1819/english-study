We going to referencing a OSI model a lot here. So If you haven't already watched video, check out the first then come back.

OK, so What is the TCP/IP model? it's a model to standardise computer networking. sounds familiar? It should! Because it's a same description as the OSI model.

Now the OSI model, while widely referenced isn't used in the real world. The TCP/IP model however, is the real deal. Thankfully is not that different.

Here is the TCP/IP model. 4 simple layers, Application, Transport, Internet and Link. and just like the OSI model, It's numbered from the bottom up, but the direction depends on if you're sending or receiving traffic.

So this is the original model, But it has been updated. Here is brand-new 
freshly designed model. One extra layer, and one renamed layer. That's it.

The link layer has been splitted into 'Data Link' and 'Physical'. And the Internet layer has been renamed the 'Network layer'. Simple right?

It gets even better when we compare the TCP/IP model to the OSI model. Now if you remember The OSI model has 7 layers compared to our five here.

but when you look at it you'll notice the application, presentation and session layers are just shown as application layer in the TCP/IP model. All the other layers line up nicely.

Which is great because we should already know the concept of how this works.
